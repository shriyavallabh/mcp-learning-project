# PART I: PYTHON MASTERY

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1.1 What is Programming? (From Absolute Basics)

### The Fundamental Concept

Imagine you want to teach a robot to make a sandwich. You can't just say "make a sandwich" because the robot doesn't understand that. You need to break it down into precise, tiny steps:

```
1. Open refrigerator door
2. Reach hand toward bread shelf
3. Grab bread bag
4. Pull bread bag out
5. Close refrigerator door
6. Open bread bag
7. Remove two slices
8. Place slices on counter
... (many more steps)
```

**This is programming.** You're giving explicit, step-by-step instructions to a computer.

### Why Computers Need Instructions

![What is Programming](images/book/ch1_what_is_programming.png)
*Figure 1.1: Programming is giving explicit, step-by-step instructions to a computer*


**Humans are intelligent:**
- You: "Make me dinner"
- Friend: *figures out what you like, checks ingredients, makes something*

**Computers are fast but not intelligent:**
- You: "Make me dinner"
- Computer: ERROR - "dinner" is undefined

**With programming:**
```python
# This is Python code - don't worry about understanding it yet
# We'll explain everything step by step

def make_dinner():
    """
    This is a FUNCTION - a reusable set of instructions.

    Breaking it down:
    - def: keyword that means "define a function"
    - make_dinner: the NAME we give this function (we chose this name)
    - (): parentheses are required (we'll learn why later)
    - """: three quotes start a documentation string
    """
    check_ingredients()  # Call another function
    prepare_food()       # Call another function
    cook_food()          # Call another function
    serve_food()         # Call another function

# Now computer knows exactly what to do!
```

### What is a Computer Program?

**A computer program is:**
1. A set of instructions
2. Written in a programming language
3. That tells a computer what to do
4. Step by step
5. In a precise, unambiguous way

**Real-world analogy:**
- **Recipe**: A program for making food
- **IKEA instructions**: A program for building furniture
- **GPS directions**: A program for navigation

### Components of a Program

Every program has:

**1. INPUT** - Data going in
```python
# Example: User types their name
name = input("What is your name? ")
# 'name' is a VARIABLE that stores the input
# We'll explain variables in detail soon
```

**2. PROCESSING** - Computer does something with the data
```python
# Example: Convert name to uppercase
uppercase_name = name.upper()
# .upper() is a METHOD that converts text to uppercase
# We'll explain methods later
```

**3. OUTPUT** - Result comes out
```python
# Example: Display the result
print(f"Hello, {uppercase_name}!")
# print() is a FUNCTION that displays text
# We'll explain functions in detail
```

**Complete example:**
```python
# INPUT
name = input("What is your name? ")

# PROCESSING
uppercase_name = name.upper()

# OUTPUT
print(f"Hello, {uppercase_name}!")
```

**If user types "alice", program outputs:**
```
Hello, ALICE!
```

### Why Learn Programming?

**1. Automation**
- Task that takes 8 hours manually → 5 minutes with code
- Example: Renaming 10,000 files

**2. Problem Solving**
- Break complex problems into steps
- Build solutions from scratch
- Create tools that don't exist yet

**3. Career Opportunities**
- Software Developer: $80k-200k+/year
- AI Engineer: $120k-300k+/year
- Data Scientist: $100k-250k+/year

**4. Understanding Technology**
- Know how apps, websites, AI work
- Not just a user, but a creator
- Shape the future of technology

**5. Creative Expression**
- Build anything you can imagine
- Games, apps, websites, robots
- Limited only by your imagination

## 1.2 What is Python? (Complete Understanding)

**Python** is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

### What is a Programming Language?

Think of it like human languages (English, Spanish, etc.):

**Human languages:**
- Let humans communicate with each other
- Have grammar rules (syntax)
- Have vocabulary (words)

**Programming languages:**
- Let humans communicate with computers
- Have syntax (grammar rules)
- Have keywords (vocabulary)

### Why Python? (Not Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.)

**Python is designed for humans:**

```python
# Python - reads almost like English
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot!")
    turn_on_AC()
```

Compare to other languages:

```java
// Java - more complex
if (temperature > 30) {
    System.out.println("It's hot!");
    turnOnAC();
}
```

```c
// C - even more complex
if (temperature > 30) {
    printf("It's hot!\n");
    turnOnAC();
}
```

### Python Characteristics (What Makes It Special)

#### 1. High-Level Language

**Low-level (Close to computer):**
```assembly
; Assembly language - very difficult
MOV AL, 61h
ADD AL, 01h
```

**High-level (Close to human language):**
```python
# Python - very easy
number = 97
number = number + 1
```

Python handles complex computer details automatically so you can focus on solving problems.

#### 2. Interpreted Language

**What does "interpreted" mean?**

**Compiled languages (like C):**
```
Your Code → Compiler → Executable File → Run
(wait)       (wait)                     (fast)
```

**Interpreted languages (like Python):**
```
Your Code → Python Interpreter → Run Immediately
                                 (slightly slower but instant)
```

**Advantage:** Write code, run immediately, see results, make changes, repeat.

#### 3. Dynamically Typed

**Statically typed (Java, C):**
```java
// Must declare type
int age = 25;              // age is integer, period
age = "twenty-five";       // ERROR! Can't change type
```

**Dynamically typed (Python):**
```python
# No type declaration needed
age = 25                   # age is integer
age = "twenty-five"        # Now age is string - totally fine!
age = [25]                 # Now age is list - also fine!
```

**What this means:**
- **Variable**: Container that holds data
- **Type**: Kind of data (number, text, etc.)
- **Static typing**: Type locked in when created
- **Dynamic typing**: Type can change anytime

**Breaking it down EXTREMELY:**
```python
age = 25
```

**What happens in this one line:**

1. **`age`**
   - This is a VARIABLE NAME
   - You chose this name
   - Could have been `x`, `user_age`, `years_old`, anything
   - Convention: use descriptive names

2. **`=`**
   - This is the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
   - NOT mathematical equals
   - Means: "put the value on right into variable on left"
   - Read as: "age GETS the value 25"

3. **`25`**
   - This is a LITERAL VALUE
   - Specifically: an INTEGER (whole number)
   - Python automatically knows it's an integer
   - No need to declare type

4. **Overall process:**
   - Python creates a variable named `age`
   - Python recognizes 25 as an integer
   - Python puts 25 into the `age` variable
   - Now whenever you write `age`, Python knows it means 25

#### 4. Object-Oriented

**Everything in Python is an object.**

**What is an object?**
- Object = thing that has data and behaviors
- Like a real-world object

**Real-world example: A car**
- **Data (attributes):** color, speed, fuel level
- **Behaviors (methods):** start(), stop(), accelerate()

**Python example:**
```python
# String is an object
name = "Alice"

# name has data (the text "Alice")
# name has behaviors (methods we can call)

# Call the upper() method
uppercase_name = name.upper()
# Result: "ALICE"
```

**Breaking down `name.upper()`:**

1. **`name`**
   - VARIABLE containing the string "Alice"
   - "Alice" is an OBJECT (specifically, a string object)

2. **`.`**
   - DOT OPERATOR
   - Means: "access something that belongs to this object"
   - In this case: access a method

3. **`upper`**
   - METHOD NAME
   - A method is a FUNCTION that belongs to an object
   - This particular method converts text to uppercase

4. **`()`**
   - PARENTHESES
   - Means: "execute this method"
   - Empty parentheses = no additional information needed

5. **Overall:**
   - Take the object `name`
   - Call its `upper` method
   - Method returns "ALICE"
   - Store result in `uppercase_name`

We'll explore objects in extreme detail in Chapter 6.

#### 5. Extensive Standard Library

Python comes with "batteries included" - hundreds of built-in tools.

**Example - working with dates:**
```python
# Without importing anything extra, Python can't do dates
# But Python includes a datetime module

import datetime
# 'import' - KEYWORD that loads a module
# 'datetime' - MODULE NAME (collection of date/time tools)

# Now we can use datetime's features
today = datetime.date.today()
# datetime.date.today() - FUNCTION CALL
# Returns today's date

print(today)  # Output: 2024-01-15 (example)
```

**Breaking down `import datetime`:**

1. **`import`**
   - KEYWORD (special word with meaning in Python)
   - Tells Python: "I want to use code from a module"

2. **`datetime`**
   - MODULE NAME
   - A module is a file containing Python code
   - This module has tools for working with dates and times
   - Comes with Python (standard library)

3. **What happens:**
   - Python finds the datetime module
   - Python loads it into memory
   - Now you can use datetime's features
   - Use it by writing `datetime.something`

**More standard library examples:**

```python
# Math operations
import math
result = math.sqrt(16)  # Square root → 4.0

# Random numbers
import random
dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)  # Random number 1-6

# Working with files
import os
files = os.listdir('.')  # List files in current directory

# Making web requests
import urllib.request
response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com')
```

Each of these is a MODULE in Python's standard library. There are hundreds more!

### Python's Philosophy: The Zen of Python

Type this in Python:
```python
import this
```

You'll see:
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
...
```

**What does this mean in practice?**

**"Beautiful is better than ugly":**
```python
# Beautiful (clear, readable)
total = sum(numbers)

# Ugly (confusing, hard to read)
t=0
for n in numbers:t=t+n
```

**"Simple is better than complex":**
```python
# Simple
if x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Found")

# Complex (unnecessarily complicated)
if x == 1 or x == 2 or x == 3:
    print("Found")
```

**"Readability counts":**
```python
# Readable (anyone can understand)
customer_total_purchase_amount = 0
for item in shopping_cart:
    customer_total_purchase_amount += item.price

# Unreadable (short but cryptic)
ct=0
for i in sc:ct+=i.p
```

## 1.3 Why Python for AI? (Detailed Explanation)

Python has become THE language for AI and machine learning. Here's why:

### 1. Dominant AI Ecosystem

**Almost every major AI tool is Python-based:**

**Deep Learning Frameworks:**
- TensorFlow (Google)
- PyTorch (Meta/Facebook)
- Keras
- JAX

**ML Libraries:**
- scikit-learn (general ML)
- XGBoost (gradient boosting)
- LightGBM (fast gradient boosting)

**NLP (Natural Language Processing):**
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- spaCy
- NLTK

**LLM Application Frameworks:**
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- Haystack

**Computer Vision:**
- OpenCV
- PIL/Pillow
- torchvision

**If you want to work in AI, you MUST know Python.**

### 2. Simple Syntax = Focus on Algorithms

Compare implementing a neural network:

**Python (with PyTorch):**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define neural network
class NeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 50)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(50, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

# Create and use
model = NeuralNet()
output = model(input_data)
```

**C++ (equivalent functionality) - Much more complex:**
```cpp
// Would be 100+ lines of complex code
// Memory management, pointer arithmetic, etc.
```

Python lets you focus on the AI logic, not the programming details.

### 3. Jupyter Notebooks for Interactive Development

**Jupyter Notebook** = Interactive Python environment perfect for AI:

```python
# Cell 1: Load data
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
data.head()  # See first rows immediately

# Cell 2: Visualize
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(data['column'])
plt.show()  # Graph appears immediately

# Cell 3: Train model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cell 4: Evaluate
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')  # See result immediately
```

**Why this is powerful:**
- See results immediately after each step
- Make changes and re-run specific parts
- Mix code, visualizations, and notes
- Perfect for experimentation

### 4. Massive Community

**Stack Overflow questions:**
- Python: 2+ million questions
- Python for AI/ML: Hundreds of thousands

**What this means for you:**
- Any problem you face, someone has solved it
- Copy-paste solutions (with understanding!)
- Active forums, Discord servers, Reddit communities

**Example: You're stuck on a problem**
1. Google your error message
2. Find Stack Overflow question
3. See 10 different solutions with explanations
4. Try solution, works immediately
5. Learn from explanation

### 5. Industry Standard

**Companies using Python for AI:**

- **OpenAI**: ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E
- **Anthropic**: Claude (what you're reading!)
- **Google DeepMind**: AlphaGo, Gemini
- **Meta**: LLaMA, PyTorch

**Why you need it:**
- Install packages
- Run Python scripts
- Use version control (Git)
- Professional development requires it

**Basic commands you'll use:**

**Navigate directories:**
```bash
# See where you are
pwd                    # Print Working Directory

# List files
ls                     # Mac/Linux
dir                    # Windows

# Change directory
cd folder_name         # Enter folder
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
```

**Create and delete:**
```bash
# Create directory
mkdir my_project       # Make directory

# Create file
touch file.py          # Mac/Linux
type nul > file.py     # Windows

# Delete file
rm file.py             # Mac/Linux
del file.py            # Windows
```

**Run Python:**
```bash
# Run Python file
python script.py       # Windows
python3 script.py      # Mac/Linux

# Start Python interactive mode
python                 # Type Python commands directly
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> exit()             # Leave Python
```

### Step 5: Your First Python Program

Let's write your first program! We'll do it step-by-step.

**Using VS Code:**

- Open VS Code
- File → Open Folder
- Select `python_learning`

**2. Create your first Python file:**
- File → New File
- Save as `hello.py`
- **Note:** The `.py` extension is CRUCIAL - tells VS Code it's Python

**3. Write this code:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**4. Run it:**
- Right-click in editor
- Select "Run Python File in Terminal"
- See output in terminal panel below: `Hello, World!`

**Congratulations! You just wrote and ran your first Python program! 🎉**

### Understanding What Just Happened

Let's break down that one line of code in EXTREME detail:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**`print`:**
- This is a FUNCTION
- A function is a reusable piece of code that does something
- `print` is a BUILT-IN function (comes with Python)
- Its purpose: display text on the screen
- Think of it like a command: "Python, please show this text"

**`(`:**
- This is an OPENING PARENTHESIS
- When you see parentheses after a function name, it means "call this function" (execute it)
- Calling = running = executing (all mean the same thing)

**`"Hello, World!"`:**
- This is a STRING
- String = text data
- Quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`) tell Python "this is text, not code"
- Everything between quotes is treated as literal text
- This is the ARGUMENT we're passing to the print function
- Argument = input data for a function

**`)`:**
- This is a CLOSING PARENTHESIS
- Must match the opening parenthesis
- Completes the function call

**Overall execution flow:**

![Program Execution Flow](images/book/ch1_first_program_flow.png)
*Figure 1.3: How Python executes your first program*

1. Python reads the line
2. Recognizes `print` as a built-in function
3. Sees `(` which means "call this function"
4. Reads the argument `"Hello, World!"`
5. Executes the print function with that argument
6. print function sends text to the output (your screen)
7. You see: Hello, World!

### 🎯 TRY THIS NOW!

**Challenge:** Modify your program to print 3 different messages!

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Python is amazing!")
print("I am learning to code!")
```

**Run it and see what happens!**

<details>
<summary>🎁 Click to see what you should see...</summary>

```
Hello, World!
Python is amazing!
I am learning to code!
```

Each `print()` creates a new line. Try changing the messages to your own!
</details>

### 💡 FUN FACT

**Did you know?** "Hello, World!" was first used in 1974 by Brian Kernighan in a programming tutorial. It's now a tradition that every programmer's first program prints "Hello, World!"

### ❓ QUICK QUIZ

**Question 1:** What happens if you forget the closing `"` in a string?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

You'll get a **SyntaxError**! Python won't know where the string ends.

```python
print("Hello, World!)  # Error: missing closing quote
```

Python will show: `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`

EOL = End Of Line
</details>

**Question 2:** Can you call `print()` with nothing inside the parentheses?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Yes!** `print()` with no arguments prints a blank line.

```python
print("Hello")
print()  # Blank line
print("World")
```

Output:
```
Hello

World
```
</details>

---

### Making It Interactive

Let's make a program that asks for your name:

```python
# Ask user for their name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Greet the user
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

**Running this:**
```
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

**Breaking down EVERY element:**

**Line 1: `# Ask user for their name`**
- `#` - This is a COMMENT marker
- Everything after `#` on a line is a comment
- Comments are IGNORED by Python
- They're notes for humans reading the code
- Good code has comments explaining what and why

**Line 2: `name = input("What is your name? ")`**

Let's break this down piece by piece:

**`name`**
- This is a VARIABLE NAME
- Variables store data
- You choose the name (could be `x`, `user_name`, anything)
- Convention: use descriptive names in lowercase with underscores
- `name` is descriptive (we know it will store a name)

**`=`**
- This is the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
- NOT mathematical equals!
- Means: "take the value on the right and put it in the variable on the left"
- Read as: "name GETS the value of..."

**`input`**
- This is another BUILT-IN FUNCTION
- Purpose: get input from the user
- Waits for user to type something and press Enter
- Returns (gives back) whatever the user typed

**`("What is your name? ")`**
- Parentheses call the function
- `"What is your name? "` is the prompt
- This text is shown to the user
- Note the space after `?` - for nice formatting

**What happens when this line runs:**
1. Python calls the input function
2. input displays: "What is your name? "
3. Cursor waits for user to type
4. User types (for example: "Alice")
5. User presses Enter
6. input returns "Alice" (as a string)
7. "Alice" is assigned to the variable `name`
8. Now `name` contains "Alice"

**Line 4: `print("Hello, " + name + "!")`**

**`print`** - We know this function now

**`"Hello, "`** - A string containing "Hello, " (with space)

**`+`** - When used with strings, this is the CONCATENATION operator
- Concatenation = joining strings together
- `"Hello, " + "Alice"` becomes `"Hello, Alice"`

**`name`**
- Our variable from before
- Currently contains "Alice"
- When Python sees a variable name, it substitutes the value

**`+`** - Another concatenation

**`"!"`** - A string containing just an exclamation mark

**What happens:**
1. Python evaluates the expression: `"Hello, " + name + "!"`
2. Substitutes `name` with its value: `"Hello, " + "Alice" + "!"`
3. Performs concatenations left to right:
   - `"Hello, " + "Alice"` → `"Hello, Alice"`
   - `"Hello, Alice" + "!"` → `"Hello, Alice!"`
4. Calls print with "Hello, Alice!"
5. Outputs: Hello, Alice!

### A More Advanced First Program

Let's create a simple calculator:

```python
# Get first number from user
num1 = input("Enter first number: ")

# Get second number from user
num2 = input("Enter second number: ")

# Convert strings to numbers
num1 = float(num1)
num2 = float(num2)

# Calculate sum
total = num1 + num2

# Display result
print("The sum is:", total)
```

**Running this:**
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
The sum is: 8.0
```

**New concepts introduced:**

**`float(num1)`**
- `float` is a FUNCTION that converts to floating-point number
- Floating-point number = number with decimal point
- Why needed? `input()` always returns a STRING
- Even if user types "5", input returns "5" (text)
- Can't do math with text!
- `float("5")` converts text "5" to number 5.0

**Math with `+`:**
- With numbers: `5 + 3` = `8` (addition)
- With strings: `"5" + "3"` = `"53"` (concatenation)
- That's why conversion is crucial!

**Multiple arguments to print:**
```python
print("The sum is:", total)
```
- `print` can take multiple arguments
- Separate with commas
- Automatically adds spaces between them
- Equivalent to: `print("The sum is: " + str(total))`

This program demonstrates:
- ✅ User input
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Type conversion
- ✅ Math operations
- ✅ Output

You're already programming! 🎉

## 1.5 Python Interactive Mode (The REPL)

**REPL** stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It's an interactive way to write Python code.

### Starting the REPL

**Open your terminal and type:**
```bash
python
```

**You'll see:**
```python
Python 3.11.5 (main, Jan 15 2024, 10:00:00)
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

**What this means:**
- `>>>` is the PROMPT - Python is waiting for you to type
- You can now type Python code and see results immediately

### Using the REPL

**Basic math:**
```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> 10 * 2
20
>>> 100 / 4
25.0
```

**Each time:**
1. You type an expression
2. Python READS it
3. Python EVALUATES (calculates) it
4. Python PRINTS the result
5. Python LOOPS back to waiting for more input

**Variables in REPL:**
```python
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> age = 25
>>> print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
Alice is 25 years old
```

**The REPL remembers everything in the session:**
```python
>>> x = 10
>>> y = 20
>>> z = x + y
>>> z
30
```

All these variables stay in memory until you close the REPL.

### When to Use REPL vs Scripts

**Use REPL for:**
- Testing small code snippets
- Learning new functions
- Calculator tasks
- Experimenting
- Quick testing

**Use Scripts (.py files) for:**
- Real programs
- Code you want to save
- Multiple lines of complex logic
- Sharing with others
- Production code

### Exiting the REPL

```python
>>> exit()
```

Or press:
- **Ctrl+D** (Mac/Linux)
- **Ctrl+Z** then Enter (Windows)

---

### 🎯 TRY THIS NOW: REPL Experiments!

Open your Python REPL and try these:

**Experiment 1: Calculator**
```python
>>> 100 / 3
>>> 10 ** 2  # 10 squared
>>> 2 ** 100  # Huge number!
```

**Experiment 2: String Fun**
```python
>>> "Python" * 3
>>> "Hello " + "World" * 2
>>> "HELLO".lower()
```

**Experiment 3: Type Discovery**
```python
>>> type(42)
>>> type(3.14)
>>> type("hello")
>>> type(True)
```

### ⚡ PRO TIP: REPL Shortcuts

**Use the UP arrow key** to recall previous commands! No need to retype.

```python
>>> x = 100
>>> x * 2
200
>>> # Press UP arrow
>>> x * 2  # Command appears again!
```

**Use `_` to get the last result:**
```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> _ * 2  # Same as: 8 * 2
16
>>> _ + 10  # Same as: 16 + 10
26
```

### 🎮 CHAPTER 1 FINAL CHALLENGE: Temperature Converter

**Your Mission:** Build a program that:
1. Asks user for temperature in Fahrenheit
2. Converts it to Celsius using the formula: `C = (F - 32) × 5/9`
3. Prints both temperatures

**Try it yourself!**

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```python
# Get temperature from user
fahrenheit = input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ")
fahrenheit = float(fahrenheit)  # Convert to number

# Convert to Celsius
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

# Display results
print(f"{fahrenheit}°F = {celsius:.1f}°C")
```

**Note:** The `:.1f` in the f-string means "show 1 decimal place"
</details>

# Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types (Complete Mastery)

## 2.1 Understanding Variables at a Deep Level

### What Exactly Is a Variable?

A variable is a **named location in computer memory** that stores a value.

**Physical Reality:**
Your computer has RAM (Random Access Memory) - billions of tiny storage locations.

```
Memory (simplified):
Address:  0x001  0x002  0x003  0x004  0x005  ...
Content:  [  0]  [ 42]  [  0]  [ 97]  [  0]  ...
```

**Without variables, you'd need to remember addresses:**
```python
# Imagine if Python worked like this (it doesn't!)
store_value_at_address_0x002(42)
print_value_at_address_0x002()  # 42
```

**With variables, you use names:**
```python
# Python does the address management for you!
age = 42
print(age)  # 42
```

### The Variable Creation Process (What Actually Happens)

When you write:
```python
age = 25
```

**Python does this behind the scenes:**

**Step 1: Create the value**
- Python creates an integer object with value 25
- This object gets a memory address (e.g., 0x1234567890)

**Step 2: Create the name**
- Python creates an entry in a "name table" (dictionary)
- Entry: `"age" → 0x1234567890`

**Step 3: Connect them**
- The name "age" now POINTS TO the object at that address

```
┌──────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  age     │────────>│ Integer Object   │
│ (name)   │         │ Value: 25        │
└──────────┘         │ Address: 0x1234  │
                     └──────────────────┘
```

**This is crucial to understand:**
- Variables don't "contain" values
- Variables are REFERENCES to objects
- The actual value lives in memory
- The variable is just a name that points to it

### Variables Are Labels, Not Boxes

![Variables as References](images/book/ch2_variables_references.png)
*Figure 2.1: Variables are references/labels, not containers*


**Common misconception (WRONG):**
```
┌──────────┐
│   age    │
│          │
│   [25]   │  ← Value inside variable (WRONG!)
└──────────┘
```

**Reality (CORRECT):**
```
age ────────────> [25]
 ↑                 ↑
Label         Object in memory
```

**Why this matters:**

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]  # x points to a list
y = x          # y points to THE SAME list

x.append(4)    # Modify the list through x

print(y)       # [1, 2, 3, 4] ← y sees the change too!
```

**What happened:**
```
x ──┐
    ├──────> [1, 2, 3, 4]
y ──┘             ↑
              Same list
```

Both variables point to the same object!

---

### 🎯 TRY THIS NOW: Variable References

**Experiment to understand references:**

```python
# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
your_list = my_list  # Both point to same list!

# Modify through my_list
my_list.append(4)

# Check your_list
print(your_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] - it changed too!
```

**Why does this happen?** Both variables are labels pointing to the **same** list object!

### 💡 FUN FACT: Python's Memory Optimization

Python optimizes memory for small integers! Try this:

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 5
>>> a is b  # True - same object!

>>> x = 1000
>>> y = 1000
>>> x is y  # False - different objects!
```

Small integers (-5 to 256) are cached and reused! But large integers create new objects.

## 2.2 Naming Variables (The Complete Guide)

### Python's Naming Rules (What's Allowed)

**Rule 1: Must start with letter or underscore**

✅ **Valid:**
```python
name = "Alice"       # Starts with letter
_private = 42        # Starts with underscore
Name = "Bob"         # Capital letter okay
name2 = "Charlie"    # Can have numbers after first character
```

❌ **Invalid:**
```python
2name = "Alice"      # SyntaxError: cannot start with number
$price = 100         # SyntaxError: $ not allowed
@username = "bob"    # SyntaxError: @ not allowed
```

**Rule 2: Can contain letters, numbers, underscores**

✅ **Valid:**
```python
user_name_123 = "Alice"
UserName = "Bob"
USERNAME = "CHARLIE"
user123name = "Dave"
_internal_var = 42
__private = 100
```

❌ **Invalid:**
```python
user-name = "Alice"      # SyntaxError: hyphen not allowed
user.name = "Bob"        # SyntaxError: dot not allowed (that's attribute access)
user name = "Charlie"    # SyntaxError: space not allowed
```

**Rule 3: Case-sensitive**

These are ALL different variables:
```python
name = "Alice"
Name = "Bob"
NAME = "Charlie"
nAmE = "Dave"

print(name)  # Alice
print(Name)  # Bob
print(NAME)  # Charlie
print(nAmE)  # Dave
```

**Rule 4: Cannot be a reserved keyword**

Python has 35 reserved keywords that you cannot use as variable names:

```python
# These are ALL invalid variable names:
if = 5           # SyntaxError
for = 10         # SyntaxError
while = 20       # SyntaxError
def = 30         # SyntaxError
class = 40       # SyntaxError
return = 50      # SyntaxError
```

**Complete list of reserved keywords:**
```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

**How to check if a word is a keyword:**
```python
import keyword

# Check if 'if' is a keyword
print(keyword.iskeyword('if'))      # True

# Check if 'name' is a keyword
print(keyword.iskeyword('name'))    # False

# Get list of all keywords
print(keyword.kwlist)
# ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', ...]
```

### Python Naming Conventions (Best Practices)

**Convention 1: snake_case for variables and functions**

✅ **Pythonic (good):**
```python
user_name = "Alice"
total_price = 100.50
calculate_tax = lambda x: x * 0.08
```

❌ **Not Pythonic (but valid):**
```python
userName = "Alice"       # camelCase (used in JavaScript)
UserName = "Bob"         # PascalCase (used for classes)
user-name = "Charlie"    # kebab-case (not valid in Python!)
```

**Convention 2: UPPER_CASE for constants**

```python
# Constants (values that shouldn't change)
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
PI = 3.14159
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://localhost/mydb"
API_KEY = "abc123xyz"
```

**Note:** Python doesn't enforce constants - you CAN change them:
```python
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 200  # Allowed, but you shouldn't do this!
```

The uppercase is a signal to other developers: "Don't change this!"

**Convention 3: PascalCase for classes**

```python
class UserAccount:      # Class names
    pass

class DatabaseConnection:
    pass

class HTTPRequest:
    pass
```

We'll learn about classes in Chapter 6.

**Convention 4: Single leading underscore for "internal" use**

```python
_internal_variable = "not for public use"

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._internal = 42       # Internal to this class
        self.public = 100         # Public

    def _helper_method(self):     # Internal method
        pass

    def public_method(self):      # Public method
        pass
```

The underscore doesn't make it private (Python has no true private), but it's a convention saying "this is internal, don't use it outside this module/class."

**Convention 5: Double leading underscore for name mangling**

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private = 42       # Name mangling applied

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.__private)              # AttributeError
print(obj._MyClass__private)      # 42 (actual name after mangling)
```

Python transforms `__private` to `_MyClass__private` to avoid name collisions in inheritance.

### Choosing Good Variable Names

**Bad names (unclear):**
```python
a = "John Doe"
b = 30
c = "john@example.com"
d = True

def f(x):
    return x * 2
```

**Good names (clear):**
```python
full_name = "John Doe"
age = 30
email_address = "john@example.com"
is_verified = True

def double_value(number):
    return number * 2
```

**Guidelines:**

**1. Be descriptive**
```python
# Bad
t = 86400

# Good
seconds_in_day = 86400
```

**2. Use meaningful words**
```python
# Bad
usrnm = "alice"
pwd = "secret123"

# Good
username = "alice"
password = "secret123"
```

**3. Avoid abbreviations (unless very common)**
```python
# Bad
msg_cnt = 5

# Good
message_count = 5

# Okay (common abbreviations)
html_content = "<div>Hello</div>"
url = "https://example.com"
id = 12345
```

**4. Boolean variables should sound like questions**
```python
# Good boolean names
is_active = True
has_permission = False
can_edit = True
should_retry = False
was_successful = True
```

**5. Collections should be plural**
```python
# Good
users = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
prices = [10.99, 5.49, 3.00]
results = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Bad
user = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]  # Singular but contains multiple
```

### ❓ QUICK QUIZ: Variable Naming

**Test your knowledge!**

**Question 1:** Which of these are valid variable names?
```python
a) user_name
b) 2nd_place
c) _private
d) user-name
e) UserName
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Valid:** a, c, e

**Invalid:**
- b: Can't start with a number
- d: Hyphens not allowed (use underscores instead)
</details>

**Question 2:** What naming convention should you use for this?
```python
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**UPPER_CASE** - This is the convention for constants!

Even though Python doesn't enforce constants, the uppercase naming signals to other developers: "Don't change this value!"
</details>

### 🎮 CODING CHALLENGE: Variable Name Refactoring

**Bad code (unclear names):**
```python
a = "John"
b = 25
c = a + " is " + str(b) + " years old"
print(c)
```

**Your mission:** Rewrite with good, descriptive variable names!

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
message = f"{name} is {age} years old"
print(message)
```

Much clearer! And using an f-string is more Pythonic.

## 2.3 Python Data Types (Complete Understanding)

![Python Data Types](images/book/ch2_data_types.png)
*Figure 2.2: Overview of Python's Built-in Data Types*


Python has several built-in data types. Let's understand each one deeply.

### The type() Function

**Check the type of any value:**
```python
>>> type(42)
<class 'int'>

>>> type(3.14)
<class 'float'>

>>> type("Hello")
<class 'str'>

>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>

>>> type(None)
<class 'NoneType'>
```

**Breaking down** `<class 'int'>`:
- **class**: In Python, types are actually classes
- **int**: The type name (integer)
- This tells you: the value 42 is an instance of the int class

### Integers (int) - Whole Numbers

**What are integers?**
- Whole numbers (no decimal point)
- Can be positive, negative, or zero
- Unlimited size in Python!

**Examples:**
```python
age = 25              # Positive integer
temperature = -10     # Negative integer
zero = 0              # Zero
big = 123456789012345678901234567890  # Huge number (still works!)
```

**Creating integers in different bases:**

```python
# Decimal (base 10) - normal numbers
x = 42

# Binary (base 2) - prefix 0b
x = 0b101010          # 42 in binary

# Octal (base 8) - prefix 0o
x = 0o52              # 42 in octal

# Hexadecimal (base 16) - prefix 0x
x = 0x2A              # 42 in hexadecimal

print(x)              # Always prints 42 (decimal)
```

**What is base 2, 8, 16?**

**Base 10 (Decimal - what humans use):**
- Digits: 0-9
- 42 = 4×10¹ + 2×10⁰

**Base 2 (Binary - what computers use):**
- Digits: 0-1
- 101010 = 1×32 + 0×16 + 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 0×1 = 42

**Base 16 (Hexadecimal - compact for programmers):**
- Digits: 0-9, A-F
- 2A = 2×16 + 10 = 42

**Underscores for readability (Python 3.6+):**
```python
# Hard to read
million = 1000000

# Easy to read
million = 1_000_000

# Works anywhere
billion = 1_000_000_000
price = 1_234.56
```

Python ignores the underscores - they're just for human readability.

### Floats (float) - Decimal Numbers

**What are floats?**
- Numbers with decimal points
- Can represent fractions
- Limited precision (not perfect)

**Examples:**
```python
pi = 3.14159
price = 10.99
temperature = -5.5
zero = 0.0          # Still a float (has decimal point)
```

**Scientific notation:**
```python
# Large numbers
speed_of_light = 3e8            # 3 × 10^8 = 300000000.0
avogadro = 6.022e23             # 6.022 × 10^23

# Small numbers
planck = 6.626e-34              # 6.626 × 10^-34 = 0.0000000000...

# Breaking down 3e8:
# 3e8 means "3 times 10 to the power of 8"
# e = "exponent"
# 3e8 = 3 * 10**8 = 300000000.0
```

**Float precision issues (IMPORTANT!):**

```python
# Floats are not perfectly accurate
print(0.1 + 0.2)              # 0.30000000000000004 (not 0.3!)
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)       # False!
```

**Why does this happen?**
- Computers store numbers in binary
- Some decimal numbers can't be represented exactly in binary
- Like how 1/3 = 0.333... (infinite) in decimal
- 0.1 in decimal = infinite binary: 0.0001100110011...

**How to handle this:**

**Option 1: Use rounding for comparisons**
```python
result = 0.1 + 0.2
expected = 0.3

# Don't do this:
if result == expected:        # False!
    print("Equal")

# Do this instead:
if abs(result - expected) < 0.00001:
    print("Equal enough!")
```

**Option 2: Use Decimal for exact arithmetic**
```python
from decimal import Decimal

# Create Decimal from string (not float!)
x = Decimal('0.1')
y = Decimal('0.2')

print(x + y)                  # Decimal('0.3')
print(x + y == Decimal('0.3'))  # True!
```

**When to use Decimal:**
- Financial calculations (money)
- When exact precision matters
- Scientific calculations

**When float is fine:**
- Most everyday programming
- Machine learning (approximate is okay)
- Graphics and games

### Strings (str) - Text Data

**What are strings?**
- Sequence of characters
- Text data
- Immutable (can't be changed after creation)

**Creating strings:**
```python
# Single quotes
name = 'Alice'

# Double quotes
greeting = "Hello, World!"

# Both are exactly the same
'Hello' == "Hello"          # True
```

**When to use which quotes:**

```python
# Use double quotes when string contains single quote
message = "It's a beautiful day"

# Use single quotes when string contains double quote
quote = 'She said "Hello"'

# Or escape the quote
message = 'It\'s a beautiful day'
quote = "She said \"Hello\""
```

**Breaking down escaping:**
- `\` is the ESCAPE CHARACTER
- It tells Python: "the next character is special"
- `\'` means: a literal single quote (not end of string)
- `\"` means: a literal double quote (not end of string)

**Triple quotes for multi-line strings:**
```python
long_text = """
This is a long text
that spans multiple lines.
Very convenient!
"""

# Also works with single quotes
also_multiline = '''
Multiple lines
work here too.
'''

# Useful for docstrings
def my_function():
    """
    This is a docstring.
    It documents what the function does.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
    """
    pass
```

**String concatenation (joining):**
```python
first = "Hello"
second = "World"

# Using +
combined = first + " " + second       # "Hello World"

# Using multiple arguments to print
print(first, second)                  # Hello World (automatic space)

# Using f-strings (best way - Python 3.6+)
combined = f"{first} {second}"        # "Hello World"
```

**F-strings explained in detail:**
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Old way (don't use)
message = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old"

# New way (use this!)
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old"
```

**Breaking down f-strings:**
- `f` before the quote: tells Python "this is an f-string"
- `{name}`: curly braces with variable name
- Python substitutes the variable's value
- Can have expressions inside: `{age + 1}`

**More f-string examples:**
```python
price = 10.99

# Basic substitution
print(f"Price: ${price}")              # Price: $10.99

# With expressions
print(f"Double: ${price * 2}")         # Double: $21.98

# With formatting
print(f"Price: ${price:.1f}")          # Price: $10.9 (1 decimal)
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")          # Price: $10.99 (2 decimals)

# With alignment
print(f"{'Left':<10}|")                # Left      |
print(f"{'Center':^10}|")              # Center  |
print(f"{'Right':>10}|")               #      Right|
```

**Breaking down `{price:.2f}`:**
- `price`: variable name
- `:`: starts format specification
- `.2`: two decimal places
- `f`: format as float

### String Indexing and Slicing

**Strings are sequences - you can access individual characters:**

```python
text = "Hello"

# Indexing (get single character)
print(text[0])      # 'H' (first character)
print(text[1])      # 'e' (second character)
print(text[4])      # 'o' (fifth character)

# Negative indexing (from end)
print(text[-1])     # 'o' (last character)
print(text[-2])     # 'l' (second from end)
```

**Index positions:**
```
   H   e   l   l   o
   0   1   2   3   4    (positive indices)
  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1    (negative indices)
```

**Slicing (get substring):**
```python
text = "Hello World"

# Syntax: string[start:end]
# start: inclusive
# end: exclusive

print(text[0:5])     # "Hello" (indices 0,1,2,3,4)
print(text[6:11])    # "World" (indices 6,7,8,9,10)

# Omit start (defaults to beginning)
print(text[:5])      # "Hello"

# Omit end (defaults to end)
print(text[6:])      # "World"

# Negative indices
print(text[-5:])     # "World" (last 5 characters)
print(text[:-6])     # "Hello" (everything except last 6)

# Step (every nth character)
print(text[::2])     # "HloWrd" (every 2nd character)
print(text[::-1])    # "dlroW olleH" (reverse string!)
```

**Complete slicing syntax:**
```python
string[start:end:step]
```
- `start`: where to begin (inclusive)
- `end`: where to stop (exclusive)
- `step`: how many to skip

**Examples:**
```python
text = "Hello World"

text[0:11:1]        # "Hello World" (normal)
text[0:11:2]        # "HloWrd" (every 2nd)
text[::3]           # "HlWl" (every 3rd from start)
text[::-1]          # "dlroW olleH" (reversed)
```

### String Methods (Essential Operations)

Strings have MANY built-in methods. Here are the most important ones:

**Case conversion:**
```python
text = "Hello World"

text.upper()        # "HELLO WORLD"
text.lower()        # "hello world"
text.title()        # "Hello World" (title case)
text.capitalize()   # "Hello world" (first letter only)
text.swapcase()     # "hELLO wORLD" (swap all cases)
```

**Breaking down** `text.upper()`:
- `text`: the string object
- `.`: dot operator (access member of object)
- `upper`: method name (function that belongs to string)
- `()`: parentheses to call the method
- Returns: new string in uppercase

**Note:** The original string is unchanged!
```python
text = "hello"
uppercase = text.upper()

print(text)         # "hello" (original unchanged)
print(uppercase)    # "HELLO" (new string)
```

**Why?** Strings are IMMUTABLE in Python.

**Checking content:**
```python
text = "Hello123"

text.isalpha()      # False (contains numbers)
text.isdigit()      # False (contains letters)
text.isalnum()      # True (only letters and numbers)
text.isspace()      # False (not all whitespace)
text.islower()      # False (has uppercase)
text.isupper()      # False (has lowercase)

# Examples
"abc".isalpha()     # True
"123".isdigit()     # True
"abc123".isalnum()  # True
"   ".isspace()     # True
```

**Finding and replacing:**
```python
text = "Hello World Hello"

# Find (returns index, or -1 if not found)
text.find("World")      # 6 (index where found)
text.find("Python")     # -1 (not found)

# Index (like find, but raises error if not found)
text.index("World")     # 6
text.index("Python")    # ValueError!

# Count occurrences
text.count("Hello")     # 2
text.count("o")         # 3

# Replace
text.replace("Hello", "Hi")     # "Hi World Hi"
text.replace("o", "0")          # "Hell0 W0rld Hell0"

# Note: original unchanged
print(text)             # "Hello World Hello"
```

**Splitting and joining:**
```python
# Split string into list
sentence = "Hello World Python"
words = sentence.split()        # ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']

# Split on specific character
csv = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = csv.split(",")         # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Split with limit
text = "a-b-c-d-e"
parts = text.split("-", 2)      # ['a', 'b', 'c-d-e'] (max 2 splits)

# Join list into string
words = ['Hello', 'World']
sentence = " ".join(words)      # "Hello World"

fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
csv = ",".join(fruits)          # "apple,banana"
```

**Breaking down** `" ".join(words)`:
- `" "`: a space character (this is what goes between items)
- `.join()`: method that joins list items into string
- `words`: the list to join

**Trimming whitespace:**
```python
text = "  Hello  "

text.strip()        # "Hello" (removes from both ends)
text.lstrip()       # "Hello  " (removes from left)
text.rstrip()       # "  Hello" (removes from right)

# Strip specific characters
text = "***Hello***"
text.strip("*")     # "Hello"
```

**Starts with / ends with:**
```python
filename = "document.pdf"

filename.endswith(".pdf")       # True
filename.endswith(".doc")       # False

filename.startswith("doc")      # True
filename.startswith("image")    # False

# Useful for file handling
if filename.endswith((".pdf", ".doc", ".txt")):
    print("It's a document")
```

### Booleans (bool) - True/False Values

**What are booleans?**
- Only two possible values: `True` or `False`
- Used for conditions and decision-making
- Named after George Boole (mathematician)
- First letter MUST be capitalized

**Creating booleans:**
```python
is_valid = True          # Boolean literal True
is_error = False         # Boolean literal False

# Result of comparisons
age = 25
is_adult = age >= 18     # True (25 is >= 18)

# Result of expressions
has_permission = True
can_edit = has_permission and is_adult    # True (both are True)
```

**Breaking down** `is_adult = age >= 18`:

1. **`is_adult`** - VARIABLE NAME (you chose this)
2. **`=`** - ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
3. **`age`** - VARIABLE containing 25
4. **`>=`** - COMPARISON OPERATOR (greater than or equal to)
5. **`18`** - INTEGER LITERAL to compare against
6. **Overall**: Compare 25 >= 18, result is True, store in `is_adult`

**Comparison operators (produce booleans):**
```python
x = 10
y = 20

# Equal to
x == y              # False (10 is not equal to 20)

# Not equal to
x != y              # True (10 is not equal to 20)

# Greater than
x > y               # False (10 is not greater than 20)

# Less than
x < y               # True (10 is less than 20)

# Greater than or equal to
x >= 10             # True (10 is equal to 10)

# Less than or equal to
x <= 5              # False (10 is not less than or equal to 5)
```

**IMPORTANT:** `==` vs `=`
```python
# ASSIGNMENT (single =)
x = 10              # Put 10 into x

# COMPARISON (double ==)
x == 10             # Check if x equals 10 (returns True/False)

# Common mistake:
if x = 10:          # SyntaxError! Can't assign in if statement
    pass

# Correct:
if x == 10:         # Comparison - returns True or False
    pass
```

**Boolean operators (combine booleans):**

**AND operator - both must be True:**
```python
has_ticket = True
has_id = True

can_enter = has_ticket and has_id    # True (both are True)

# Truth table for AND:
True and True       # True
True and False      # False
False and True      # False
False and False     # False
```

**OR operator - at least one must be True:**
```python
is_admin = False
is_owner = True

can_delete = is_admin or is_owner    # True (one is True)

# Truth table for OR:
True or True        # True
True or False       # True
False or True       # True
False or False      # False
```

**NOT operator - reverses the boolean:**
```python
is_logged_in = True
is_guest = not is_logged_in          # False

# Examples:
not True            # False
not False           # True
```

**Combining operators:**
```python
age = 25
has_license = True
has_car = False

# Complex condition
can_drive = age >= 18 and has_license and (has_car or rental_available)

# Breaking this down:
# 1. age >= 18 evaluates to True (25 >= 18)
# 2. has_license is True
# 3. has_car is False
# 4. If rental_available is True:
#    - (has_car or rental_available) = False or True = True
#    - True and True and True = True
# 5. If rental_available is False:
#    - (has_car or rental_available) = False or False = False
#    - True and True and False = False
```

**Operator precedence (order of operations):**
```python
# NOT has highest precedence, then AND, then OR
result = True or False and False
# Evaluates as: True or (False and False)
# = True or False
# = True

# Use parentheses for clarity:
result = (True or False) and False    # False
result = True or (False and False)    # True
```

**Boolean type conversion:**

**Values that are "Falsy" (convert to False):**
```python
bool(False)         # False
bool(0)             # False (zero is falsy)
bool(0.0)           # False (zero float is falsy)
bool("")            # False (empty string is falsy)
bool([])            # False (empty list is falsy)
bool({})            # False (empty dict is falsy)
bool(None)          # False (None is falsy)
```

**Values that are "Truthy" (convert to True):**
```python
bool(True)          # True
bool(1)             # True (non-zero number is truthy)
bool(-1)            # True (any non-zero is truthy)
bool("Hello")       # True (non-empty string is truthy)
bool([1, 2, 3])     # True (non-empty list is truthy)
bool({"key": "val"})  # True (non-empty dict is truthy)
```

**Practical example:**
```python
username = input("Enter username: ")

# Instead of:
if username != "":
    print("Welcome,", username)

# You can do:
if username:        # Non-empty string is truthy
    print("Welcome,", username)

# More examples:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
if numbers:         # Non-empty list is truthy
    print("List has items")

score = 0
if not score:       # 0 is falsy, not False makes it True
    print("No score yet")
```

### None Type - Representing "Nothing"

**What is None?**
- Represents the absence of a value
- Python's equivalent of "null" in other languages
- Only one None object exists in memory
- Type is `NoneType`

**Using None:**
```python
# Variable with no value yet
result = None

# Function that doesn't return anything
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
    # No return statement = implicitly returns None

return_value = greet("Alice")
# Prints: Hello, Alice
print(return_value)
# Prints: None
```

**Breaking down None:**
```python
x = None

# x is a VARIABLE
# None is a SPECIAL VALUE (singleton object)
# There's only ONE None object in Python
# Every variable set to None points to the same object
```

**Checking for None:**
```python
result = None

# CORRECT way (use 'is'):
if result is None:
    print("No result")

# INCORRECT way (use ==):
if result == None:      # Works, but not idiomatic
    print("No result")

# Why 'is' is better:
# 'is' checks if it's the SAME object (identity)
# '==' checks if values are EQUAL (equality)
# Since there's only one None object, 'is' is perfect
```

**Common None usage patterns:**
```python
# Default parameter values
def process_data(data=None):
    if data is None:
        data = []       # Create empty list if no data provided
    # Process data...

# Optional return values
def find_user(user_id):
    user = database.get(user_id)
    if user:
        return user
    else:
        return None     # Explicitly return None if not found

# Initialize variables
user = None
score = None
# ... later assign actual values
```

**None vs empty:**
```python
# None means "no value"
result = None

# Empty string means "value is an empty string"
result = ""

# They're different!
print(result is None)    # False (it's an empty string, not None)
print(result == "")      # True (it equals empty string)

# Empty list
items = []
print(items is None)     # False (it's an empty list, not None)
print(len(items) == 0)   # True (list length is zero)
```

>>> type(None)
>>> type([1, 2, 3])
```

### ❓ QUICK QUIZ: Data Types

**Question 1:** What's the output?
```python
x = "5"
y = "3"
print(x + y)
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Output:** `53`

Why? Both are strings! The `+` operator concatenates (joins) strings, not adds numbers.

To add them as numbers:
```python
print(int(x) + int(y))  # 8
```
</details>

**Question 2:** What does this evaluate to?
```python
bool("")  # Empty string
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**False**

Empty strings are "falsy" in Python. Only non-empty strings are "truthy".

```python
bool("Hello")  # True
bool("")       # False
bool(" ")      # True (space is a character!)
```
</details>

### 💡 FUN FACT: String Multiplication

You can "multiply" strings in Python!

```python
>>> "Python " * 3
'Python Python Python '

>>> "=" * 50
'=================================================='

>>> "-" * 20
'--------------------'
```

Great for creating separators and patterns!

### 🐛 DEBUG CHALLENGE: Find the Bug!

**This code has a bug. Can you spot it?**

```python
user_age = "25"
dog_age = 3
total = user_age + dog_age
print(f"Combined ages: {total}")
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>

Check the types! What type is `user_age`? What type is `dog_age`?
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

**The bug:** Trying to add a string and an integer!

`user_age` is `"25"` (string), but `dog_age` is `3` (integer). Can't add them directly!

**Fixed code:**
```python
user_age = "25"
dog_age = 3
user_age = int(user_age)  # Convert to integer
total = user_age + dog_age  # Now it works!
print(f"Combined ages: {total}")  # 28
```

Or just make user_age an integer from the start:
```python
user_age = 25
dog_age = 3
total = user_age + dog_age
```
</details>

## 2.4 Type Conversion (Casting) - Extreme Detail

**Type conversion** (also called **casting**) = changing a value from one type to another.

### Why Type Conversion is Necessary

**Problem without conversion:**
```python
# User input is always a string
age = input("Enter your age: ")    # User types: 25
# age is "25" (string), not 25 (integer)

# Try to do math:
next_year_age = age + 1            # TypeError: can't concatenate str and int

# String + number doesn't work!
```

**Solution with conversion:**
```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")    # age is "25" (string)
age = int(age)                     # age is now 25 (integer)
next_year_age = age + 1            # Works! 25 + 1 = 26
```

### Converting to Integer: int()

![Type Conversion](images/book/ch2_type_conversion.png)
*Figure 2.3: Type Conversion Between Different Python Types*


**Function:** `int(value)`
**Purpose:** Convert value to integer

**From string:**
```python
# String containing number
x = int("42")         # 42 (integer)
x = int("  100  ")    # 100 (strips whitespace)
x = int("-50")        # -50 (handles negative)

# Errors:
x = int("3.14")       # ValueError: invalid literal (has decimal point)
x = int("hello")      # ValueError: invalid literal (not a number)
x = int("42.0")       # ValueError: (looks like number but has .0)
```

**From float:**
```python
# Truncates (cuts off) decimal part
x = int(3.14)         # 3 (decimal removed, not rounded!)
x = int(3.99)         # 3 (not 4 - it truncates, doesn't round)
x = int(-2.7)         # -2 (removes .7)

# To round instead of truncate:
x = int(round(3.7))   # 4 (round first, then convert)
```

**From boolean:**
```python
x = int(True)         # 1
x = int(False)        # 0

# This is why True/False can be used in math:
sum = True + True + False    # 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
```

**From other bases (binary, octal, hex):**
```python
# Second parameter is the base
x = int("1010", 2)    # 10 (binary 1010 = decimal 10)
x = int("77", 8)      # 63 (octal 77 = decimal 63)
x = int("FF", 16)     # 255 (hex FF = decimal 255)

# Without base parameter, assumes base 10
x = int("10")         # 10 (decimal)
x = int("10", 10)     # 10 (explicitly decimal)
```

### Converting to Float: float()

**Function:** `float(value)`
**Purpose:** Convert value to floating-point number

**From string:**
```python
x = float("3.14")       # 3.14
x = float("  2.5  ")    # 2.5 (strips whitespace)
x = float("-1.5")       # -1.5 (handles negative)
x = float("10")         # 10.0 (integer string becomes float)

# Scientific notation:
x = float("1.5e2")      # 150.0 (1.5 × 10^2)
x = float("3.14e-2")    # 0.0314 (3.14 × 10^-2)

# Special values:
x = float("inf")        # inf (infinity)
x = float("-inf")       # -inf (negative infinity)
x = float("nan")        # nan (Not a Number)

# Errors:
x = float("hello")      # ValueError: could not convert
```

**From integer:**
```python
x = float(42)           # 42.0
x = float(0)            # 0.0
x = float(-10)          # -10.0
```

**From boolean:**
```python
x = float(True)         # 1.0
x = float(False)        # 0.0
```

### Converting to String: str()

**Function:** `str(value)`
**Purpose:** Convert value to string

**From numbers:**
```python
x = str(42)             # "42"
x = str(3.14)           # "3.14"
x = str(-100)           # "-100"

# Now it's text, not a number:
y = str(10) + str(20)   # "1020" (concatenation, not addition!)
```

**From boolean:**
```python
x = str(True)           # "True" (string)
x = str(False)          # "False" (string)

# Note the capital T and F
```

**From None:**
```python
x = str(None)           # "None" (string)
```

**From collections:**
```python
x = str([1, 2, 3])      # "[1, 2, 3]" (string representation)
x = str({"key": "val"}) # "{'key': 'val'}" (string representation)
```

**Practical use - combining numbers and text:**
```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"

# Wrong way (TypeError):
# message = "I am " + age + " years old"    # Can't concatenate str and int

# Right ways:
message = "I am " + str(age) + " years old"        # Convert to string
message = f"I am {age} years old"                  # F-string (best!)
message = "I am {} years old".format(age)          # .format() method
```

### Converting to Boolean: bool()

**Function:** `bool(value)`
**Purpose:** Convert value to True or False

**Falsy values (become False):**
```python
bool(0)             # False
bool(0.0)           # False
bool("")            # False (empty string)
bool([])            # False (empty list)
bool(())            # False (empty tuple)
bool({})            # False (empty dictionary)
bool(set())         # False (empty set)
bool(None)          # False
bool(False)         # False
```

**Truthy values (become True):**
```python
bool(1)             # True (any non-zero number)
bool(-1)            # True
bool(0.1)           # True
bool("text")        # True (non-empty string)
bool(" ")           # True (even just whitespace)
bool([1])           # True (non-empty list)
bool((1,))          # True (non-empty tuple)
bool({"a": 1})      # True (non-empty dict)
bool(True)          # True
```

**Practical examples:**
```python
# Check if string has content
username = input("Enter username: ")
if bool(username):    # or just: if username:
    print("Valid username")
else:
    print("Username cannot be empty")

# Check if list has items
results = []
if bool(results):     # or just: if results:
    print("Found results")
else:
    print("No results found")
```

### Type Conversion Pitfalls (Common Mistakes)

**Mistake 1: Not converting input**
```python
# WRONG:
age = input("Age: ")      # age is string "25"
if age > 18:              # TypeError: can't compare str and int
    print("Adult")

# RIGHT:
age = int(input("Age: "))  # Convert immediately
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
```

**Mistake 2: Converting invalid strings**
```python
# WRONG:
price = input("Price: ")   # User enters "12.99"
price = int(price)         # ValueError! Can't convert "12.99" to int

# RIGHT:
price = input("Price: ")
price = float(price)       # 12.99 as float
```

**Mistake 3: Losing precision**
```python
x = 3.99
y = int(x)          # y is 3 (not 4!)
# int() truncates, doesn't round!

# If you want rounding:
y = round(x)        # 4 (properly rounded)
```

**Mistake 4: Forgetting that strings can look like numbers**
```python
x = "10"
y = "20"
result = x + y      # "1020" (string concatenation)

# To add as numbers:
result = int(x) + int(y)    # 30 (addition)
```

## 2.5 Arithmetic Operators (Complete Understanding)

Python provides operators for mathematical operations. Let's understand each one in extreme detail.

### Addition (+)

**With numbers:**
```python
# Integer addition
result = 10 + 5         # 15
result = -3 + 7         # 4
result = 0 + 100        # 100

# Float addition
result = 3.5 + 2.1      # 5.6
result = 10.0 + 5       # 15.0 (becomes float)

# Mixed int and float
result = 10 + 5.5       # 15.5 (int + float = float)
```

**Breaking down** `10 + 5.5`:
1. **`10`** - INTEGER literal
2. **`+`** - ADDITION OPERATOR
3. **`5.5`** - FLOAT literal
4. **Process**: Python converts 10 to 10.0, then adds: 10.0 + 5.5 = 15.5
5. **Result type**: FLOAT (whenever you mix int and float, result is float)

**With strings (concatenation):**
```python
result = "Hello" + "World"      # "HelloWorld"
result = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # "Hello World"

# Numbers become strings when you use str()
result = "Number: " + str(42)   # "Number: 42"

# ERROR - can't add string and number directly:
# result = "Age: " + 25         # TypeError!
```

**With lists (joining):**
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = list1 + list2          # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Note: Original lists unchanged
print(list1)                    # [1, 2, 3]
print(list2)                    # [4, 5, 6]
```

### Subtraction (-)

```python
# Basic subtraction
result = 10 - 5         # 5
result = 5 - 10         # -5 (can be negative)
result = 10.5 - 3.2     # 7.3

# Subtracting negative (double negative becomes positive)
result = 10 - (-5)      # 15 (same as 10 + 5)

# Multiple operations
result = 100 - 20 - 10  # 70 (evaluated left to right)
```

**Important:** Order matters!
```python
a = 10 - 5              # 5
b = 5 - 10              # -5 (different!)
```

### Multiplication (*)

```python
# Basic multiplication
result = 10 * 5         # 50
result = 3.5 * 2        # 7.0
result = -3 * 4         # -12

# Negative times negative = positive
result = -3 * -4        # 12

# Zero multiplication
result = 1000 * 0       # 0 (anything times zero is zero)
```

**With strings (repetition):**
```python
result = "Hello" * 3    # "HelloHelloHello"
result = "=" * 20       # "===================="
result = "*" * 5        # "*****"

# Practical use - creating separators
line = "-" * 50
print(line)             # --------------------------------------------------
```

**Breaking down** `"Hello" * 3`:
1. **`"Hello"`** - STRING object
2. **`*`** - MULTIPLICATION OPERATOR (when used with string + int, means repeat)
3. **`3`** - INTEGER (how many times to repeat)
4. **Result**: String "Hello" repeated 3 times

**With lists (repetition):**
```python
result = [1, 2] * 3     # [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
result = [0] * 10       # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Practical use - creating lists with default values
zeros = [0] * 5         # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
empty_strings = [""] * 3  # ["", "", ""]
```

### Division (/)

**Always returns a float:**
```python
result = 10 / 2         # 5.0 (not 5!)
result = 10 / 3         # 3.3333333333333335
result = 7 / 2          # 3.5
result = 100 / 10       # 10.0 (float even though division is exact)
```

**Important:** Even when dividing evenly, result is float!
```python
result = 10 / 2
print(result)           # 5.0
print(type(result))     # <class 'float'>
```

**Division by zero:**
```python
result = 10 / 0         # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

This crashes your program! Always check before dividing:
```python
divisor = 0
if divisor != 0:
    result = 10 / divisor
else:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

### Floor Division (//)

**Returns integer, rounds down:**
```python
result = 10 // 3        # 3 (not 3.333... - just the whole part)
result = 7 // 2         # 3 (not 3.5 - rounded down)
result = 20 // 6        # 3 (not 3.333...)

# Always rounds DOWN (toward negative infinity)
result = -7 // 2        # -4 (not -3!)
```

**Breaking down** `10 // 3`:
1. **`10`** - INTEGER (dividend)
2. **`//`** - FLOOR DIVISION OPERATOR (divide and round down)
3. **`3`** - INTEGER (divisor)
4. **Process**: 10 ÷ 3 = 3.333..., round down to 3
5. **Result**: 3 (INTEGER)

**Regular division vs floor division:**
```python
print(7 / 2)            # 3.5 (regular division - float)
print(7 // 2)           # 3 (floor division - integer)

print(10 / 3)           # 3.3333333333333335
print(10 // 3)          # 3
```

**With floats:**
```python
result = 10.0 // 3      # 3.0 (result is float if either operand is float)
result = 10 // 3.0      # 3.0
result = 10.0 // 3.0    # 3.0
```

### Modulus (%) - Remainder

**Returns the remainder after division:**
```python
result = 10 % 3         # 1 (10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1)
result = 15 % 4         # 3 (15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3)
result = 20 % 5         # 0 (20 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 0)
result = 7 % 2          # 1 (7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1)
```

**Breaking down** `10 % 3`:
1. **`10`** - INTEGER (dividend)
2. **`%`** - MODULUS OPERATOR (get remainder)
3. **`3`** - INTEGER (divisor)
4. **Process**: 10 ÷ 3 = 3 with remainder 1
5. **Result**: 1 (the REMAINDER)

**Visual explanation:**
```
10 ÷ 3:
  3 goes into 10 three times (3 × 3 = 9)
  Remainder: 10 - 9 = 1
  So: 10 % 3 = 1
```

**Practical uses:**

**1. Check if number is even or odd:**
```python
number = 7
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")        # Prints "Odd" because 7 % 2 = 1
```

**2. Get last digit:**
```python
number = 12345
last_digit = number % 10    # 5 (last digit)
```

**3. Cycle through values:**
```python
# Hours on a 12-hour clock
hour = 15               # 3 PM
display_hour = hour % 12  # 3 (converts 15 to 3)

# Days of week (0-6)
day = 10
day_of_week = day % 7   # 3 (day 10 is same as day 3 in a week cycle)
```

**4. Check divisibility:**
```python
number = 15
if number % 3 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 3")  # Prints this (15 % 3 = 0)
```

### Exponentiation (**) - Power

**Raises number to a power:**
```python
result = 2 ** 3         # 8 (2 × 2 × 2)
result = 5 ** 2         # 25 (5 × 5)
result = 10 ** 0        # 1 (anything to power 0 is 1)
result = 10 ** 1        # 10 (anything to power 1 is itself)
```

**Breaking down** `2 ** 3`:
1. **`2`** - BASE (number being multiplied)
2. **`**`** - EXPONENTIATION OPERATOR (power)
3. **`3`** - EXPONENT (how many times to multiply)
4. **Process**: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
5. **Result**: 8

**Fractional exponents (roots):**
```python
# Square root: number ** 0.5
result = 16 ** 0.5      # 4.0 (square root of 16)
result = 9 ** 0.5       # 3.0

# Cube root: number ** (1/3)
result = 27 ** (1/3)    # 3.0 (cube root of 27)
result = 8 ** (1/3)     # 2.0
```

**Negative exponents (reciprocals):**
```python
result = 2 ** -1        # 0.5 (1/2)
result = 10 ** -2       # 0.01 (1/100)
result = 5 ** -1        # 0.2 (1/5)
```

**Large numbers (Python handles them!):**
```python
result = 2 ** 100       # 1267650600228229401496703205376 (works!)
result = 10 ** 50       # 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

### Operator Precedence (Order of Operations)

Just like in math, Python follows an order:

**Priority (high to low):**
1. **Parentheses** `()`
2. **Exponentiation** `**`
3. **Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus** `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. **Addition, Subtraction** `+`, `-`

**Examples:**
```python
# Without parentheses:
result = 2 + 3 * 4      # 14 (not 20!)
# Explanation: 3 * 4 = 12, then 2 + 12 = 14

# With parentheses:
result = (2 + 3) * 4    # 20
# Explanation: (2 + 3) = 5, then 5 * 4 = 20

# Complex example:
result = 2 ** 3 + 10 / 2 - 4
# Step 1: 2 ** 3 = 8
# Step 2: 10 / 2 = 5.0
# Step 3: 8 + 5.0 = 13.0
# Step 4: 13.0 - 4 = 9.0
# Result: 9.0

# With parentheses for clarity:
result = (2 ** 3) + (10 / 2) - 4  # Same result, more readable
```

**Best practice:** Use parentheses when in doubt, even if not needed:
```python
# Both work, second is clearer:
result = a + b * c
result = a + (b * c)    # Easier to read
```

### Compound Assignment Operators

**Shorthand for common operations:**

```python
# Long way:
x = 10
x = x + 5               # 15

# Short way:
x = 10
x += 5                  # 15 (same result)
```

**Breaking down** `x += 5`:
1. **`x`** - VARIABLE
2. **`+=`** - COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR (add and assign)
3. **`5`** - VALUE to add
4. **Equivalent to**: `x = x + 5`

**All compound operators:**
```python
x = 10

x += 5      # x = x + 5      → x is now 15
x -= 3      # x = x - 3      → x is now 12
x *= 2      # x = x * 2      → x is now 24
x /= 4      # x = x / 4      → x is now 6.0
x //= 2     # x = x // 2     → x is now 3.0
x %= 2      # x = x % 2      → x is now 1.0
x **= 3     # x = x ** 3     → x is now 1.0
```

**With strings:**
```python
message = "Hello"
message += " World"     # message is now "Hello World"

# Equivalent to:
message = message + " World"
```

**With lists:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers += [4, 5]       # numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Equivalent to:
numbers = numbers + [4, 5]
```

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Calculate circle area**
```python
# Area = π × r²
PI = 3.14159
radius = 5

area = PI * radius ** 2
print(f"Circle area: {area}")  # Circle area: 78.53975
```

**Breaking this down:**
- `PI` - CONSTANT (uppercase by convention)
- `radius ** 2` - Calculate 5² = 25 (exponentiation first)
- `PI * 25` - Multiply 3.14159 × 25 = 78.53975

**Example 2: Temperature conversion**
```python
# Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
celsius = 25
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print(f"{celsius}°C = {fahrenheit}°F")  # 25°C = 77.0°F
```

**Example 3: Calculate average**
```python
# Average of 5 numbers
sum_total = 85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88
count = 5
average = sum_total / count
print(f"Average: {average}")  # Average: 86.6
```

**Example 4: Split bill**
```python
# Split restaurant bill
total_bill = 156.75
num_people = 4
tip_percentage = 0.18

# Calculate tip
tip = total_bill * tip_percentage  # 28.215

# Total with tip
total_with_tip = total_bill + tip  # 184.965

# Per person
per_person = total_with_tip / num_people  # 46.24125

print(f"Each person pays: ${per_person:.2f}")  # Each person pays: $46.24
```

**Breaking down** `{per_person:.2f}`:
- `per_person` - VARIABLE containing 46.24125
- `:.2f` - FORMAT SPECIFICATION (2 decimal places, float)
- Result: `46.24` (rounded to 2 decimals)

### 🎮 CHAPTER 2 MEGA CHALLENGE: Build a Complete Calculator!

**Your Mission:** Create a calculator that:
1. Asks for two numbers
2. Asks for an operation (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
3. Performs the calculation
4. Shows the result with proper formatting

**Try it yourself first!**

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

You'll need:
- `input()` to get numbers and operation
- `float()` to convert inputs to numbers
- `if/elif/else` statements (we'll learn these in Chapter 4, but try using them!)
- Or use a simple approach with multiple operations
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution (Simple Version)</summary>

```python
# Get inputs
num1 = input("Enter first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter second number: ")
operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Convert to numbers
num1 = float(num1)
num2 = float(num2)

# Calculate (simple version - just show all operations)
print(f"\n{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")
print(f"{num1} // {num2} = {num1 // num2}")
print(f"{num1} % {num2} = {num1 % num2}")
print(f"{num1} ** {num2} = {num1 ** num2}")
```
</details>

### ❓ FINAL QUIZ: Chapter 2 Mastery

**Question 1:** What's the type of the result?
```python
x = 10 / 2
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**float** (5.0)

Division (`/`) ALWAYS returns a float, even if the result is a whole number.

```python
>>> type(10 / 2)
<class 'float'>
>>> 10 / 2
5.0
```

For integer result, use `//`:
```python
>>> 10 // 2
5
```
</details>

**Question 2:** What will this print?
```python
name = "Alice"
print(name[1:4])
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

`lic`

Slicing `[1:4]` gets characters at index 1, 2, 3 (not including 4):
- Index 1: 'l'
- Index 2: 'i'
- Index 3: 'c'
</details>

**Question 3:** How do you check if a variable is None?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

Use `is None`:
```python
result = None
if result is None:
    print("No result")
```

NOT `== None` (works but not idiomatic)
</details>

### ⚡ PRO TIPS for Chapter 2

**Tip 1:** Use f-strings for ALL string formatting
```python
# Old way (don't use)
message = "Hello, " + name + "!"

# New way (best!)
message = f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Tip 2:** Type hint your variables (Python 3.5+)
```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 25
price: float = 19.99
is_active: bool = True
```

**Tip 3:** Use meaningful variable names
```python
# Bad
t = 86400

# Good
seconds_per_day = 86400
```

### 💪 BONUS CHALLENGE: BMI Calculator

**Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator:**
- Formula: `BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)²`
- Ask for weight and height
- Calculate and display BMI
- Bonus: Tell user their category (underweight/normal/overweight/obese)

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>

```python
# Get inputs
weight = input("Enter your weight in kg: ")
height = input("Enter your height in meters: ")

# Convert to numbers
weight = float(weight)
height = float(height)

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Display result
print(f"\nYour BMI: {bmi:.1f}")

# Bonus: Categories
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("Category: Underweight")
elif bmi < 25:
    print("Category: Normal weight")
elif bmi < 30:
    print("Category: Overweight")
else:
    print("Category: Obese")
```

Note: Uses `if/elif/else` which we'll learn in Chapter 4!
</details>

### 🏆 CHAPTER 2 ACHIEVEMENT: "Data Types Master!"

**You've mastered:**
- ✅ Variables and references
- ✅ All basic data types
- ✅ Type conversion
- ✅ Arithmetic operations
- ✅ String manipulation
- ✅ Boolean logic

**Progress:** `██████████░░░░░░ 30%` (Chapter 2 of 52)

**Next up:** Chapter 3 - Collections (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)!

---

# Chapter 3: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)

## 3.1 Introduction to Collections

So far, we've worked with single values:
```python
name = "Alice"          # One string
age = 25                # One number
is_active = True        # One boolean
```

But what if you need to store multiple related values?

**Example problem:**
```python
# Storing 5 student names - the wrong way
student1 = "Alice"
student2 = "Bob"
student3 = "Charlie"
student4 = "Diana"
student5 = "Eve"

# This is terrible! What if you have 100 students?
```

**Solution: Collections (Data Structures)**

Python provides four main collection types:

![Collections Overview](images/book/ch3_collections_overview.png)
*Figure 3.1: Python's Four Main Collection Types*


1. **List** `[]` - Ordered, mutable (changeable), allows duplicates
2. **Tuple** `()` - Ordered, immutable (unchangeable), allows duplicates
3. **Dictionary** `{}` - Key-value pairs, mutable, keys are unique
4. **Set** `{}` - Unordered, mutable, no duplicates

Let's learn each one in extreme detail.

## 3.2 Lists - Ordered Mutable Collections

**What is a list?**
- A LIST is a collection of items
- Items are ORDERED (maintain their position)
- Lists are MUTABLE (you can change them after creation)
- Can contain DIFFERENT TYPES of data
- Created using SQUARE BRACKETS `[]`

### Creating Lists

![List Operations](images/book/ch3_list_operations.png)
*Figure 3.2: Common List Operations and Methods*


```python
# Empty list
empty = []
print(type(empty))      # <class 'list'>

# List of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List of strings
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# List of mixed types
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True, None]

# List containing lists (nested)
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

**Breaking down** `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
1. **`numbers`** - VARIABLE NAME
2. **`=`** - ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
3. **`[`** - Opening SQUARE BRACKET (starts list)
4. **`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`** - ELEMENTS separated by commas
5. **`]`** - Closing SQUARE BRACKET (ends list)
6. **Result**: Variable `numbers` points to a list object containing 5 integers

---

### 🎯 TRY THIS NOW: Create Your First List!

**Experiment with lists:**

```python
# Create a list of your favorite things
favorites = ["Pizza", "Python", "Music", "Travel"]

# See the whole list
print(favorites)

# See how many items
print(len(favorites))  # 4

# Add another item
favorites.append("Reading")
print(favorites)  # Now has 5 items!
```

### 💡 FUN FACT: Lists Can Hold Anything!

```python
# A list can mix types
crazy_list = [
    42,                  # Integer
    "hello",             # String
    3.14,                # Float
    True,                # Boolean
    [1, 2, 3],          # Another list!
    {"key": "value"}     # Dictionary!
]

print(len(crazy_list))   # 6 items
```

This flexibility makes lists incredibly powerful!

### 🏆 CHAPTER 3 PREVIEW: "Collections Coming Soon!"

**This chapter will teach you:**
- ✅ Lists in complete detail
- ✅ Tuples (immutable lists)
- ✅ Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- ✅ Sets (unique values only)
- ✅ List comprehensions

Answer: Lists are mutable (can be changed), tuples are immutable (cannot be changed). Lists use [], tuples use (). Lists are for collections that change, tuples for fixed collections.

**2. What is a decorator?**
Answer: A decorator is a function that modifies another function. Uses @ syntax. Common examples: @property, @staticmethod, @classmethod.

**3. Explain GIL.**
Answer: Global Interpreter Lock. Prevents multiple Python threads from executing simultaneously. Important for threading vs multiprocessing decisions.

**4. What is MCP?**
Answer: Model Context Protocol - standardized way for AI applications to connect to data sources and tools. Created by Anthropic. Enables portable, reusable integrations.

**5. Difference between tools and resources in MCP?**
Answer: Tools perform actions (have side effects), resources provide data (read-only). Tools: send_email, create_user. Resources: read_file, query_data.
