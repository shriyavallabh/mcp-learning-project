## 🚀 How To Use This Project

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Completion (RECOMMENDED)

The image generation is running automatically and will complete in 5-7 hours. Just let it run!

**Current background process**: Process ID `4e0a6b`

To check progress at any time:
```bash
ls images/anime_book/*.png | wc -l
```

### Option 2: Monitor Progress

Run the monitoring script (doesn't interfere with generation):
```bash
source pdf_env/bin/activate
python3 complete_book_automation.py
```

This will:
- Show real-time progress updates
- Automatically run integration when complete
- Generate the final PDF
- Create a completion summary

### Option 3: Manual Steps After Generation

Once all 41 images are generated:

```bash
source pdf_env/bin/activate

# Step 1: Integrate images
python3 integrate_all_images_final.py

# Step 2: Generate PDF
python3 generate_final_anime_pdf.py
```
